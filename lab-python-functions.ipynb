    "```python\n",
    "import function_file\n",
    "\n",
    "function_file.function_name()\n",
    "```\n",

    "3. Renaming functions during import: You can also rename functions during import using the as keyword. This is useful if you want to use a shorter or more descriptive name for the function in your code. For example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from function_file import function_name as f\n",
    "\n",
    "f.function_name(arguments)\n",
